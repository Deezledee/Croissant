      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      but mostly associated with France. <br />
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other
      viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. <br />
      The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. <br />
      The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
