      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      but mostly associated with France. <br />
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other
      viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. <br />
      The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. <br />
      The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff
      pastry.<br />
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long been
      a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries.<br />
      The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late
      1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked
      dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled
      labor. <br />
      The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French
      response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30-40% of the
      croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen
      dough.
